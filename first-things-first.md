# First Things First
May this serve as a constant reminder.
For you...
For me...
Invest in the first things first.
Not just money. But also time, attention, evaluation, and effort.
Let's break it down...
---
## Skills/Experience
A tool is only as good as its user.
Above all, invest in yourself and others. It may not be easy, but it reaps the best rewards.
Have you learned it all?
If not, learn more.
Have you taught someone everything you know?
If not, start teaching.
## Content
Content is a sum of many parts: script, setting, talent, movement, colors, pacing, etc.
Compelling content should stand on its own, and fancy gear rarely makes poor content better.
## Audio
Most people's ears are more sensitive than their eyes.
Therefore, audio can usually make or break a production quicker than visuals can.
Listen before you look.
## Lighting
Cameras still love light.
And cameras can only work with the light they're given.
Give them the best, and most, light you can.
## Lens
Everyone likes shiny new cameras. But let's give credit where credit is due...
The lens is the "better half" of a camera. They must live in a balanced relationship.
Camera before lens = cart before horse.
## Camera
When everything before the camera is done well, camera selection becomes easier.
The camera is still a crucial part in this process, don't misunderstand this.
However, unreasonable expectations should not be placed on the camera to make up for weaknesses set in front of it.
A camera cannot work magic, but it can look magical when everything before it falls properly into place.
## Everything Else
The critical work is done!
Now you can play, adjust, evaluate, and have confidence knowing you've taken the necessary steps to create great video!
